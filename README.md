## ScoreConnect is a web based projector control software. Written using Next.js, it is fast, modern, and easy to use.

### Getting Started

You can view the public test instance at [next.necrozma.xyz](https://next.necrozma.xyz).

### Development

ScoreConnect runs on [bun](https://bun.sh/). It should also work on Node, but will be slower.

- `$ git pull https://github.com/TheBozzz34/ScoreConnect-Web.git`
- `$ cd ScoreConnect-Web`
- `$ bun install`
- `$ bun run dev`
